## Install

Add with your favorite package manager:

```sh
npm install --save all-keyboardevent-keys
# or
yarn add all-keyboardevent-keys
```

## Use

Import the default `KEY` object, then use:

```jsx
import KEY from 'all-keyboardevent-keys'
```

`KEY` is an object with nearly all available KeyboardEvent keys. You can view the [full list available here](src/index.js).

You can access word keys using dot notation:

```js
import { KEY } from 'onkey-event-manager'

KEY.Enter // 'Enter'
KEY.Tab   // 'Tab'
```

To access symbols or numbers, use bracket notation:

```js
KEY[9]    // '9'
KEY['\\'] // '\'
```

## Keyboards

Each keyboard has its own set of Keyboardevent keys. It is the goal of this project to gather all keys into a single library.
